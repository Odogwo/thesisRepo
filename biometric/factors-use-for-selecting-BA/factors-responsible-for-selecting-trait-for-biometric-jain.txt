The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain et al. (1999)[2] identified seven such factors to be used when assessing the suitability of any trait for use in biometric authentication.

Universality means that every person using a system should possess the trait.

Uniqueness means the trait should be sufficiently different for individuals in the relevant population such that they can be distinguished from one another.

Permanence relates to the manner in which a trait varies over time. More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching algorithm.

Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets.

Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see performance section for more details).

Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed.

Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.
