Basic Components of a Biometric System
In general, a biometric system can be divided into four basic components. Let us see them briefly −

Input Interface (Sensors)
It is the sensing component of a biometrics system that converts human biological data into digital form.

For example,

	A Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) imager or a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) in the case of face recognition, handprint recognition, or iris/retinal recognition systems.

	An optical sensor in case of fingerprint systems.
	A microphone in case of voice recognition systems.


Processing Unit
The processing component is a microprocessor, Digital Signal Processor (DSP), or computer that processes the data captured from the sensors.

The processing of the biometric sample involves −

	Sample image enhancement
	Sample image normalization
	Feature extraction
	Comparison of the biometric sample with all stored samples in database.


Database Store
The database stores the enrolled sample, which is recalled to perform a match at the time of authentication. For identification, there can be any memory from Random Access Memory (RAM), flash EPROM, or a data server. For verification, a removable storage element like a contact or contactless smart card is used.

Output Interface
The output interface communicates the decision of the biometric system to enable the access to the user. This can be a simple serial communication protocol RS232, or the higher bandwidth USB protocol. It could also be TCP/IP protocol, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Bluetooth, or one of the many cellular protocols.
