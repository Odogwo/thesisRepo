With increasing use of Information Technology in the field of banking, science, medication, etc., there is an immense need to protect the systems and data from unauthorized users.

Biometrics is used for authenticating and authorizing a person. Though these terms are often coupled; they mean different.

Authentication (Identification)
This process tries to find out answer of question, “Are you the same who you are claiming to be?”, or, “Do I know you?” This is one-to-many matching and comparison of a person’s biometrics with the whole database.

Verification
This is the one-to-one process of matching where live sample entered by the candidate is compared with a previously stored template in the database. If both are matching with more than 70% agreeable similarity, then the verification is successful.

Authorization
It is the process of assigning access rights to the authenticated or verified users. It tries to find out the answer for the question, “Are you eligible to have certain rights to access this resource?”

Shortcomings of Conventional Security Aids
The conventional methods of information system security used ID cards, passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), etc. They come with the following disadvantages −

They all mean recognizing some code associated with the person rather than recognizing the person who actually produced it.

They can be forgotten, lost, or stolen.
They can be bypassed or easily compromised.
They are not precise.
In such cases, the security of the system is threatened. When the systems need high level of reliable protection, biometrics comes to help by binding the identity more oriented to individual.
