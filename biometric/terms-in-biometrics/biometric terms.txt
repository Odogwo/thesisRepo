Biometric Template − It is a digital reference of the distinct characteristics that are extracted from a biometric sample.

Candidate/Subject − A person who enters his biometric sample.

Closed-Set Identification − The person is known to be existing in the database.

Enrollment − It is when a candidate uses a biometric system for the first time, it records the basic information such as name, address, etc. and then records the candidate’s biometric trait.

False Acceptance Rate (FAR) − It is the measure of possibility that a biometric system will incorrectly identify an unauthorized user as a valid user.

FAR = 
Number of False Acceptances
Number of Identification Attempts
A biometric system providing low FAR ensures high security.

False Reject Rate (FRR) − It is the measure of possibility that the biometric system will incorrectly reject an authorized user as an invalid user.

FRR = 
Number of False Rejections/
Number of Identification Attempts

Open-Set Identification − The person is not guaranteed to be existing in the database.

Task − It is when the biometric system searches the database for matching sample
